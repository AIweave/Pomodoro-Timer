Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool that can be used to dedicate timed sessions towards breaks and whatever task at hand (e.g. studying, exercising, reading, etc.)

When opening the app, the first timed "Session" will begin counting down in dedication to whatever task the user is doing.  Once the time is up, another set of time will begin.  This time is for a "Break" that's meant for resting. After the "Break" time is over, another "Session" begins for the user to continue working and the cycle repeats. 

**Controls**

Start - This button begins the "Session" timer.  
Reset - Reset the program to the first "Session" timer.
